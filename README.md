# Wordle *Brute*

## Welcome to Wordle *Brute* :

A program that narrows down possible words for Wordle using elimination.

You will be asked to enter:

1. â¬›/â¬œ **BLACK/GREY** letters first
2. ðŸŸ¨ followed by the **YELLOW** letters
3. ðŸŸ© then the **GREEN** letters.

The program accepts *both* UPPERCASE and lowercase letters.

For best results, *refer to Wordle's colored letters on the on-screen keyboard* when entering Black/Grey and Yellow letters.

Use asterisk * in place of letters of other colors when entering your Green letters.

A list will be generated with *possible* words.

Simply run the program again when you have more black, yellow, and green letters to get a shorter list.

**UPDATE 1:** 16 Feb 2022

Added the revised list by the New York Times, see nyt_list.py

Updated main.py to work with both the original Wordle list and the NYTimes list
